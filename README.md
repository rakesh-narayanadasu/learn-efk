# EFK Stack Learning Repository

This repository contains my learnings, experiments, and notes on the **EFK Stack** â€” **Elasticsearch**, **Fluentd**, and **Kibana** â€” commonly used for centralized logging and log analysis in cloud-native environments.

## ðŸ“š What is the EFK Stack?

The EFK stack is a popular logging solution composed of:

- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
- **Fluentd**: An open-source data collector that helps unify data collection and consumption.
- **Kibana**: A data visualization dashboard for Elasticsearch.

Together, they allow collection, storage, search, and visualization of logs in a scalable and flexible way.
