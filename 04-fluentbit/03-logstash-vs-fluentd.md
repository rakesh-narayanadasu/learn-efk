# Logstash vs Fluent Bit

## Why Replace Logstash?

Logstash has served many well, but it comes with certain limitations that **Fluent Bit** addresses effectively. Below is a one-to-one comparison highlighting the key differences between the two tools.



## Core Features

| Feature              | Logstash                                          | Fluent Bit                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Implementation**   | Written in JRuby; requires a Java Runtime Environment | Developed primarily in C with some Ruby components |
| **Dependency Overhead** | High due to Java dependency                      | Minimal, making it considerably more lightweight |

## Ecosystems and Plugins

Both tools boast robust ecosystems, but their approaches differ:

### Logstash:
- Comes with approximately **200 centrally maintained plugins** by Elastic.
- Ensures a **consistent experience**, albeit with **limited flexibility**.

### Fluent Bit:
- Offers access to **500+ decentralized plugins** from various repositories.
- Enables **greater customization**, supported by a **vibrant developer community**.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature                    | Logstash                                                                 | Fluent Bit                                                               |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Transport & Buffering** | No built-in buffering; requires external queues like Redis or Kafka     | Built-in buffering for simpler and more reliable deployment              |
| **Performance**            | Higher memory consumption due to Java runtime and external dependencies | Lightweight and memory-efficient; ideal for edge and container setups    |
| **Event Routing**          | Advanced if-then logic for routing; flexible but complex                 | Simple tagging-based routing; easy to configure and maintain             |
| **Log Parsing**            | Requires detailed and explicit configuration for parsing                 | Built-in parsers for JSON, Regex, CSV; minimal config needed             |
