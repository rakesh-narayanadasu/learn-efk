# Inverted Index in Elasticsearch

Imagine a traditional book index that lists key terms along with the page numbers where they appear. Elasticsearch adopts a similar approach. When you add a document to Elasticsearch, the platform builds an **inverted index** that maps each term to the documents containing it. This powerful mechanism allows for fast and efficient search operations.

## How Inverted Index Works: A Practical Example

Consider three simple documents:

- **Document 1**: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"  
- **Document 2**: "the dog chased the cat"  
- **Document 3**: "the fox is cunning"  

When these documents are indexed in Elasticsearch, an inverted index is created to map individual terms to their respective document IDs.

For example:

| Term   | Document IDs        |
|--------|---------------------|
| dog    | 1, 2                |
| fox    | 1, 3                |
| the    | 1, 2, 3             |
| quick  | 1                   |
| chased | 2                   |
| cunning| 3                   |

> The index also stores **positions** of terms within each document. For instance, the term `fox` appears in both Document 1 and Document 3. This detailed mapping is essential for achieving rapid search responses.

# The Process Behind Index Creation

Elasticsearch creates the inverted index through several key steps:

## 1. Tokenization
Elasticsearch starts by breaking down each document into individual tokens.  
For example, the sentence:

`the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

is split into separate words. This process is vital for efficiently managing large volumes of text.

## 2. Normalization
During normalization, all tokens are converted to lowercase and processed for consistency.  
This ensures that searches are case-insensitive and all terms are stored in a uniform format.

## 3. Stop Word Removal
Common words such as **"the," "is," and "at"** are eliminated because they offer little value in distinguishing the document content.  
Removing these stop words reduces noise and enhances the relevance of search results.

## 4. Index Creation
Finally, Elasticsearch builds the **inverted index** â€” a structure that maps each term to the specific documents where it is found.  
This is comparable to a book's index, enabling Elasticsearch to quickly retrieve documents that match search queries.

# How Searches Utilize the Inverted Index

To understand how the inverted index enhances search queries, consider a search for the words **"fox"** and **"dog."**  

Based on our earlier example:

- **"fox"** appears in Documents **1** and **3**  
- **"dog"** appears in Documents **1** and **2**

Since **Document 1** is the only document containing both terms, Elasticsearch returns **Document 1** as the search result.
