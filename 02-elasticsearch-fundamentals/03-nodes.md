# Node Roles in Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a distributed system composed of nodes, each of which may serve one or more roles. These roles determine what functions a node performs in the cluster, enabling specialization, performance optimization, and scalability.

## Core Node Roles

### 🧠 Master Node
- Oversees **cluster-wide operations**.
- Manages **cluster state changes** such as:
  - Adding/removing nodes
  - Index creation/deletion
- Maintains critical **metadata** for cluster coordination.

---

### 🗃️ Data Node
- Responsible for **storing and indexing data**.
- Executes **search queries and aggregations**.
- Plays a critical role in:
  - Retrieving documents
  - Processing and returning results

---

### ⚙️ Data Ingest Node
- **Preprocesses documents** using ingest pipelines.
- Ideal for **real-time transformations**, such as:
  - Field extraction from logs
  - Data enrichment and formatting

---

### 🤖 ML (Machine Learning) Node
- Handles **machine learning tasks**, e.g.:
  - Anomaly detection
  - Real-time alerting on unusual patterns (e.g., traffic spikes)

---

### 🔄 Transform Node
- Executes **data summarization and aggregation** tasks.
- Converts **raw data** into structured summaries.
  - *Example*: Turn hourly sales logs into daily summaries.

---

### 🌐 Remote Cluster Client
- Facilitates **cross-cluster searches**.
- Acts as a gateway to multiple clusters.
- Enables **unified querying** across **geographically distributed environments**.

---

## Data Tier Node Roles

### 🔥 Data Hot Node
- Stores **frequently accessed data**.
- Optimized for:
  - **Low latency**
  - **High performance**
- Perfect for **real-time analytics** and dashboards.

---

### 🌡️ Data Warm Node
- Stores **moderately accessed data**.
- Balances **performance with storage cost**.
- Suitable for:
  - Weekly reports
  - Routine user activity data

---

### ❄️ Data Cold Node
- Optimized for **cost-effective storage** of infrequently accessed data.
- Ideal for:
  - **Long-term archiving**
  - **Regulatory compliance** (e.g., logs stored for years)

---

### 🧊 Data Frozen Node
- Stores **rarely accessed data**.
- Prioritizes **cost savings** over performance.
- Accepts higher latency in exchange for:
  - **Maximum storage efficiency**

---

## Distributing Node Roles Across Availability Zones

In a **multi-zone deployment**, distributing roles across availability zones boosts **resilience, performance, and fault tolerance**.

> **Example Layout**:
- **Zone A**:
  - Master Node
  - Data Node
  - Data Hot Node
- **Zone B**:
  - Data Ingest Node
  - Data Warm Node
  - Data Cold Node
  - Data Frozen Node
- **Zone C**:
  - ML Node
  - Transform Node
  - Remote Cluster Client

This architecture ensures:
- **High availability**
- **Efficient workload distribution**
- **Scalability** to support millions of real-time requests

---

By thoughtfully assigning node roles and distributing them across zones, Elasticsearch can meet diverse workloads—ranging from real-time user activity to long-term log storage—with optimal performance and reliability.
