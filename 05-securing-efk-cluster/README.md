# Security Considerations for Production Kubernetes Deployment

As your deployment grows, ensuring a robust security posture becomes essential.  
The following are critical aspects to safeguard the **Elastic Stack** within your Kubernetes environment:

- Securing your Kubernetes cluster  
- Enabling SSL/TLS encryption  
- Implementing Elastic Stack security features  
- Restricting Elasticsearch access  



## 1. Securing Your Kubernetes Cluster

The first step in maintaining a secure Elastic Stack is to **harden your Kubernetes cluster**.  
Implementing **network policies** is a fundamental practice to control pod-to-pod communication.  

For example, you might configure a policy that permits only the necessary interactions between **Kibana** and **Elasticsearch** pods, significantly reducing the risk of internal breaches.



## 2. Enabling SSL/TLS Encryption

Protecting data in transit is paramount.  
**SSL/TLS encryption** ensures that communications between nodes remain confidential and tamper-proof.

Configure your **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** settings with the appropriate certificate and key paths.  
Below is an example of how you can enable SSL/TLS in Kibana:

```yaml
# Enable SSL/TLS encryption for Kibana
kibana:
  server:
    ssl:
      enabled: true
      certificate: /path/to/cert.pem
      key: /path/to/key.pem
```

This configuration can be seamlessly integrated into your YAML files by either referencing a secure location for these files or mounting a volume that contains your certificates and keys.

> **Note:** Monitor log files for accidental exposure of sensitive data.  
If you discover any anomalies, notify your application developers immediately to prevent further data leakage.



## 3. Implementing Elastic Stack Security Features

The Elastic Stack includes built-in security mechanisms such as **authentication** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**.  
Leveraging these features ensures that only authorized users can access your Elasticsearch data.

Example configuration to enable Elastic Stack security:

```yaml
# Enable Elastic Stack security features
elasticsearch:
  security:
    enabled: true
    authc:
      realms:
        - type: basic
          order: 0
    authz:
      roles:
        - type: basic
          order: 0
```

These settings enable basic authentication and authorization mechanisms to strengthen user-level access controls.



## 4. Restricting Elasticsearch Access

Restricting access to your **Elasticsearch cluster** is another essential security measure.  
Configuring network settings to limit traffic to trusted sources—such as the Kibana host—minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Restrict access to Elasticsearch by only allowing traffic from Kibana
elasticsearch:
  network:
    host: kibana
    port: 9200
```

This setup ensures that Elasticsearch communications are strictly limited to requests originating from the Kibana host on port `9200`, thereby fortifying your deployment against potential intrusions.



## Conclusion

By adhering to these four security strategies, you can build a **resilient Elastic Stack deployment on Kubernetes**.  
These practices are equally applicable when deploying on alternative infrastructures such as **AWS EC2** or other **cloud environments**.
